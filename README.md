# PanelDragonNet
A deep learning approach to causal inference with panel data.

This repository provides an implementation of **PanelDragonNet**, which integrates individual- and time-specific embeddings into the DragonNet framework to enable causal inference in panel data settings.

Information regarding the runtime environment is documented in `env_info.txt` to ensure reproducibility of the reported results.
